# Security Policy

## Data Privacy & Zero-Logging

At **WideIntel**, we take data privacy seriously, especially given the sensitive nature of investigations conducted by our users.

### Our Promise regarding the Free Tools Arsenal:

1.  **Client-Side Processing:** Most tools (like CDR Processor, LLM Mapper, Parsers) execute JavaScript entirely within your browser. Your data does not leave your device.
2.  **No Persistent Storage:** We do not save uploaded files, logs, or analysis results on our servers. Once you refresh the page, the data is wiped.
3.  **Secure Tunnels:** For tools requiring server-side interaction (like DNS lookups), data is transmitted via encrypted HTTPS tunnels and discarded immediately after processing.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our tools, please report it to us immediately via our official contact page: [https://www.wideintel.org/contribute](https://www.wideintel.org/contribute).
