## 🏛️ MISSION PROTOCOL
**EST. 2025 // CLASSIFIED OPERATIONS**

WideIntel bridges the gap between commercial intelligence and official investigations. We provide a specialized infrastructure empowering Law Enforcement, National Security Agencies, and Cyber Defense Units to mitigate digital threats without budgetary constraints.

In an era of escalating cybercrime, verified investigators often lack immediate access to critical data due to bureaucratic red tape and paywalls. **WideIntel was engineered to solve this latency.** By aggregating fragmented breach data, public records, and dark web signals into a single **Zero-Knowledge Query Engine**, we reduce investigation times from days to seconds. 

Our mandate: **Information Superiority for the Good Guys.**

## 🔐 1. CORE INTELLIGENCE (RESTRICTED GRID)
Authorized investigators access a centralized aggregation engine that queries multiple datasets simultaneously. WideIntel operates as a centralized intelligence fusion center, aggregating real-time intelligence from commercial, government, and dark-web sources.

### 🚩 Strategic API Fusion & Modules:
* **Universal Lookup (All-in-One):** The platform's flagship engine. Executes a multi-threaded heuristic search across Breach Data, Social Media APIs, and Public Records simultaneously to build a comprehensive target profile.
* **Unified OSINT Search:** A specialized deep-web engine focusing on username enumeration and identifying hidden digital footprints across forums, gaming platforms, and obscure social networks.
* **SEON Intelligence:** Digital footprint analysis checking Email/Phone against 50+ social platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) to verify identity and activity levels.
* **OSINTCat & IntelFetch:** Versatile pivot tools that accept Email, Phone, IP, or Username and return associated entities from proprietary intelligence databases.
* **GHunt & Holehe:** Advanced profiling modules for Google Accounts and social media registration checking (120+ platforms).

## 💾 2. BREACH & LEAKS (RESTRICTED ACCESS)
Direct access to indexed databases of compromised credentials, info-stealer logs, and historical leaks for attribution and account takeover verification.

* **Unified:** A unified gateway querying multiple third-party breach repositories and stealer logs (**Redline, Raccoon, Vidar**) to find infected device fingerprints.
* **LeakCheck Global:** Queries a global index of public data breaches to retrieve hashed or plaintext passwords associated with the target.
* **HudsonRock Forensic:** Specialized search for 'Info-Stealer' malware logs. Identifies if a specific computer or employee device was compromised by botnets.
* **IntelX Archive:** Searches the dark web, paste sites, and historical leaked documents for specific selectors (domains, emails, UUIDs).
* **Snusbase & BreachBase:** Direct access to massive indices of dehashed passwords and domain-centric breach searches (e.g., @company.com).
* **HackCheck & IDLeakCheck:** High-velocity engines optimized for government and public record breaches, providing rapid attribution for national identity exposure.
